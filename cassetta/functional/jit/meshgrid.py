## Eager vs TorchScript

The signature of `torch.meshgrid` differs between eager and torchscript modes.

In eager mode, `meshgrid` takes an unpacked list of tensors as inputs:
```python
gx, gy = torch.meshgrid(coordx, coordy)
```

In torchscript mode, it takes a (packed) list of tensors instead:
```python
gx, gy = torch.meshgrid([coordx, coordy])
```

This makes writing code that works in both eager (by setting the
environment variable `PYTORCH_JIT=0`) and torchscript modes (with the
default `PYTORCH_JIT=1`) complicated. Instead, we define functions with
explicit names (`meshgrid_list_*`) that always take a (packed) list of
tensors as input.

## Backward compatibility

For `torch<1.10`, `torch.meshgrid` worked in `"ij"` mode, meaning that
the first tensor of coordinates was mapped to the first dimension of the
output grid and the second tensor of coordinates was mapped to the
second dimension of the output grid. Starting with `torch=1.10`,
the keyword argument `indexing`, which takes value `"ij"` or `"xy"`, was
introduced. Furthermore, the default behavior of the function when `indexing`
is not used will change from `"ij"` to `"xy"` in the future.

To make any code backward compatible, we define explicit functions
postfixed by either `_ij` or `_xy`.
